# textpedals

Textpedals is a visual and node based interface for manipulating text. The goal is for it to become an interface that allow transformation of strings.

The original idea was to make an interface that allows users to apply classic guitar pedal effects to pieces of strings. For instance applying a wah-wah effect to a string might result in something like this:

`This idea is stupid` ==> `Thwahs wahdwahwah wahs stwahpwahd`
